## 🛠️ Projects

I have several small projects done during all courses. Natours is the first project on which I built a lot after following the courses and where I have added many features. This is a backend project so not frontend framework is used. I plan on creating my own projects from scratch starting in march 2025. I want to stop watching courses and start coding and get a job before learning more skills.
